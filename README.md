# Neo Miss Monitor
A React Native/Expo app for viewing near-Earth objects that pass by within the next 24 hours. Uses the NASA "Asteroid NeoWs" open API.

## Usage
At present, this app requires [Expo](https://expo.io/) to be installed locally. Using Node Package Manager, run

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Next, install the Expo app on your smartphone, or ensure that you have an iPhone or Android simulator running, such as through XCode.

Inside the top level of the repository directory, run `expo start`, which should direct a browser to `localhost:19002`. From there, you can run the project in one of your simulators or click "Tunnel" then scan the QR code to run the application in the Expo app on your phone.
